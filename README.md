This is a simple vanilla javascript and expressjs backend chat app using websockets.
To make it cooler I also added an ESP8266 code for projects involving that. 
This is just some example code to help bridge electronics and webdev.
You only need to install nodejs and expressjs. The ESP8266 is optional, you'll need 
to install the drivers for that. Look in my commit messages for further explanation or
